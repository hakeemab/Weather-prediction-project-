# Weather-prediction-project-

Weather forecasting is essential because it affect many aspects of society, including 
agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. The ability to accurately predict weather 
conditions, such as temperature and sunshine, helps in planning and decision-making 
processes that can minimize risks and improve how well different areas of work run. 
In this project our goal is to predict Londonâ€™s weather based on historical weather observations. 
Our dataset is provided by the European Climate Assessment (ECA), which includes a wide 
array of weather attributes recorded by a weather station near Heathrow airport in London, UK. 
Our approach is creating a many-to-one bidirectional LSTM model (RNN) as these types of 
models are suited for time-series forecasting tasks such as weather prediction, where given a 
sequence of days, we predict the mean_temp and sunshine values for the next day. 
Libraries used in this project includes: Pytorch and tensorFlow.
